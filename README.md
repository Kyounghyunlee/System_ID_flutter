# Flutter rig system identification

Linear system ID code computes Hopf point and Modal vectors of the grey-box model (using unsteady flutter model)
from the free-decay response of the aerofoil.
Additionally it computes input form of Julia code that computes Centermanifold and Hopf normalform

Nonlinear system ID code computes nonlinear stifness parameters ka2 and ka3 by minimizing the prediction error
using normal form theory.
